the characteristics of the lost item, like the brand of the item, its colour, its dimensions, the 
place where the item has the probability to be lost, the photo of the item which is optional 
factor as the person can have the photo of the item or doesn't have it with him or her, the

characteristics of the items which are already been present in the system and if a match is 
being found then the item is shown to the person on the website and if it doesn't match then 
the person has to wait for it to being found. Now the second role is of the lost item, so that
